# LeetCode - Grind75 Challenge

This is the repo which contains my solutions to the **Grind75** study plan questions. I am using Java for this round. 

[Grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) is a study plan that contains 75 LeetCode questions in an increasing difficulty order.

My aim is to solve all the problems in 8 weeks, which is the default plan. (Number of questions and weekly time allocation can be customized but I chose to stick to the default one.)

## Main Challenge rules:
1. Solve at least one question every day.
2. Finish the plan at most in 8 weeks.
3. Tweet about your progress daily.

### Other rules:
- On the first round, try to solve without taking any hints or looking to other solutions.
- If you cannot come up with an optimized solution, try to do best. You can ignore time constraint in this case as long as all the tests pass.
- If you get stuck on a question (for example trying for more than an hour), don't waste any more time and take a quick hint by looking at example solutions, then try again to solve by yourself.
